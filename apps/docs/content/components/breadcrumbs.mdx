## Examples

<Callout type="important">
    By default, links perform native browser navigation when they are interacted with.
    However, many apps and frameworks use client side routers to avoid a full page reload when navigating between pages.
    React Aria components provide a `<RouterProvider>` so you can hook into your routing framework of choice.
    Read more about it in the <a className="underline" href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html" target="__blank">Client side Routing</a> section.
