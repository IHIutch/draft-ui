The default **`Modal`** uses size `md`.

### Sizes

You can use the `size` prop to alter the button size. Sizes `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `full` are included by default.

<ComponentExample name="modal" story="sizes" />

### Set Autofocus

You can manually control which element recieves focus when the **`Modal`** opens by setting `autoFocus` on a focusable element.

<ComponentExample name="modal" story="set-autofocus" />

### Dismissable

Modals are dismissable by clicking outside by default or by pressing the <kdb>Esc</kdb> key. To prevent this, set `isDismissable` to `false` and/or `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` to `true`.

<ComponentExample name="modal" story="dismissable-false" />
