## Install Sly CLI

You're able to install Draft UI components from the command line thanks for an awesome project by [Jacob Paris](https://twitter.com/jacobmparis), [`@sly-cli/sly`](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/).

Run the following code to add Draft UI to your project. **`sly`** will show you a list of components available to download.

```bash title="bash"
npx @sly-cli/sly add draft-ui
```

## Configuration

**`@sly-cli/sly`** let's you configure some specific settings about how you want to install components from the CLI. Assuming you've followed the initial Draft UI installation instructions, this is what your `sly.json` should look like.

```json title="sly.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://sly-cli.fly.dev/registry/config.json",
  "libraries": [
    {
      "name": "draft-ui",
      "directory": "./components",
      "transformers": ["transform-sly-install.ts"], // optional, otherwise leave empty
      "postinstall": [],
    }
  ]
}
```

Of course, if you've made your own customizations, you should update your `sly.json` to match those changes.

## Transformers

**`sly`** also allows you to manipulate how you install your components via transformers.

In order to use transformers, you'll need to install **`sly`** into your project:
```bash title="bash"
npm install -D @sly-cli/sly
```

For example, if you're not using React Server Components, your can safely remove the `use client` directive. In the snippet below, you would do this by setting **`usesServerComponents`** to `false`.

```ts title="transform-sly-install.ts"
const usesServerComponents = true // set to `false` if you're using a framework like Remix or vanilla React
const cvaConfig = '@/lib/cva.config'

/**
 * @type {import('@sly-cli/sly/dist').Transformer}
 */
export default async function transformSlyInstall(input: string) {
  if (!usesServerComponents) {
    input = input.replace(/'use client'.*/g, "")
  }

  input = input.replace('@/lib/cva.config', cvaConfig)

  return input
}
```
