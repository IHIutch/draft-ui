description: Copy and paste-able components built with React Aria Components and
  Tailwind CSS

Draft UI has been massively inspired by **`shadcn/ui`** so I encourage you to take a look at [their introduction page](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

---

Long story short, Draft UI follows all the same ideals:

- Copy and paste components give you full control over the component
  code, it is yours to use.
- Modify and adapt to your hearts content, using these docs as a
  starting point.
- These components should be able to be used in any framework that
  supports React.
- Draft UI is free to use on any personal or commercial projects.
