## Make It Your Own

I've intentionally avoided using the Tailwind config and
arbitrary values as much as possible. While you are welcome to copy
and paste these components and use them in your projects as-is, the
goal of this project is to get your projects up and running as quickly
as possible without having to worry about accessibility and
interactivity.

## Special Thanks

There are many OSS projects who have inspired and power the backbone
of this project. This project is a combination of other folks really
hard work so I'd like to recognize and thank them:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): Without the inspiration of shadcn/ui, this project would not
  exist. The idea to create a beautiful, copy and paste library
  opened my eyes on how to make a useful tool without having to
  worry about bundling, distribution, and a bunch of other things I
  don't know much about.

- [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html): The backbone of this project. I consider React Aria to be the de
  facto accessibility library on the web. Creating React Aria
  Components has made it easier than ever to build UI that is
  functional and accessible to all users.

  I'd especially like to acknowledge [@devongovett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)
  who has been representing React Aria on Twitter and has been very
  communicative about the team's progress and quick to respond
  to feedback.

- [Chakra UI](): Although not directly involved with this project, I leveraged
  many of their styling decisions where I wanted additional
  flexibility with components. I also heavily relied on their naming
  to conventions to compose components.

  I've also been heavily combing through their repo to better
  understand how their Storybook and Docs are working together.
